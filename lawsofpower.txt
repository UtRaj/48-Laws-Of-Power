The 48 Laws Of Power 
 
 
The Big Idea 
A comprehensive, well-researched synthesis of timeless philosophies –from Machiavelli to 
Suntzu, as applied in real-life situations by powerful figures in history such as Queen Elizabeth I 
and Henry Kissinger. Absorbing and entertaining, this book lends business people a wealth of 
ideas on the subtle art of playing the power game, exercising clever cunning, and understanding 
human weaknesses. Whether it is in the boardroom, at a power lunch, or a cocktail party– these 
laws will make you master of the game and give you the edge over your rivals. 
 
1. NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER. 
•  Transgression of the Law. 
Finance Minister Fouquet unintentionally outshone his master, King Louis XIV, making 
the King feel insecure by throwing a lavish party that would show off Fouquet’s 
connections, cultivated manner and charm. Thinking this move would make him an 
indispensable asset to the king, Fouquet had actually offended his master who did not 
like the fact people were more charmed by his finance minister than by him. The King 
found a convenient excuse to get rid of Fouquet. 
 
• Observance of the Law 
Galileo was clever in observing this law by giving glory to his patrons. In order to solve 
his perennial problem of funding, he dedicated his discovery of the moons of Jupiter to 
the Medicis, since the royal symbol of the Medici family was the planet Jupiter. He then 
commissioned an emblem for them, with each moon representing one of the sons who 
revolved around the patriarch. The Medici family became his major patron, appointing 
him their official court mathematician and philosopher, thereby giving him a more 
comfortable life and a steady salary. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• Present your ideas in such a manner that they may be ascribed to your master, 
or could be viewed as an echo of your master’s thoughts. 
• If you are more intelligent than your master, act as if you are not. 
• Never take your position for granted. 
• Never let favors you receive go to your head. 
• Discreet flattery is much more powerful. Make it seem like you want to seek his 
expertise and advice. 




 
2. NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN HOW TO USE 
ENEMIES. 
 


• Transgression of the Law. 
Michael III of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-ninth century A.D. placed too much 
trust in his friend, Basilius. This was a young man who had once saved his life, and in 
return, was given all the privileges an emperor could bestow on a friend. Michael 
turned the peasant Basilius into a sophisticated and educated courtier. Basilius later 
on became greedy for more wealth and power and had his former benefactor and 
best friend Michael III murdered. 
 
 
• Observance of the Law 
Emperor Sung of China in 959 A.D. was able to turn all his enemies into loyal friends. 
He persuaded his generals to retire to a life of nobility and give up their dreams of 
grabbing his throne one day. He spared those who conspired against him, and was 
able to win over enemies with his generosity.  
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• Do not rely on friends. They will never be totally honest with you. They will not 
openly disagree with you in order to avoid arguments. 
• Enemies expect nothing so they will be surprised when you are generous. 
• An enemy spared the guillotine will be more grateful to you than a friend. 
• When you decide to hire a friend you will discover qualities she has kept hidden. 
• Skill and competence are more important than friendly feelings. 
• Hiring friends will limit your power. 
• All working situations require a kind of distance between people. 
• You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him. 
• An enemy at your heels keeps you sharp, alert, and focused. 


 
3. CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS.


 
• Transgression of the Law. 
The Marquis de Sevigne was young and inexperienced in the art of love. He confided 
in the infamous courtesan of seventeenth-century France, Ninon de Lenclos, to 
instruct him on how to seduce a difficult young countess. She made him follow a plan 
over a number of weeks, where the Marquis would be appearing in public always 
surrounded by beautiful women, in the very places the countess would be expected 
to see him. He was supposed to assume an air of nonchalance. This increased the 
jealousy of the young countess, who was not sure of his interest in her. One day the 
Marquis, unable to control his passion, broke from Ninon’s plan, and blurted out to 
the countess that he loved her. After this admission, the countess no longer found 
him interesting and avoided him.  
 
• Observance of the Law 
Otto von Bismarck was a deputy in the Prussian parliament at a time when many 
fellow deputies thought it was possible to go to war against Austria and defeat it. 
Bismarck knew the Prussian army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way to 
keep the war at bay. He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked about 
the madness of war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announced 
his real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have 
won. Most Prussians wanted to go to war at that moment and mistakenly believed 
their army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity would 
have been doubted. By giving misleading statements about wanting peace and 
concealing his true purpose, Bismarck’s speech catapulted him to the position of 
prime minister. He later led the country to war against the Austrians at the right time, 
when he felt the Prussian army was more capable. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off scent. 
• Use smoke screens (a poker face) to disguise your actions. 
• False sincerity is one powerful tool that will send your rivals on a wild goose 
chase. 
• Publicly declare your false intentions to give misleading signals. 
• A noble gesture can be a smoke screen to hide your true intentions. 
• Blend in and people will be less suspicious. 
 


 
4. ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY. 
The 48 Laws Of Power 
 

 
• Transgression of the Law. 
Coriolanus was a great military hero of ancient Rome. People held him in awe, until 
he opened his mouth. He spoke his mind, hardly able to control his arrogance and 
boastfulness. He slandered and insulted people. The more speeches he made, the 
less people respected him. He suffered the people’s wrath and was eventually 
banished from the city.  
 
• Observance of the Law 
Masters of enigma Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp knew the power of saying less 
and keeping people guessing. The less Duchamp talked about his work, the more it 
was talked about in the art circles. Andy Warhol recognized it was hard to talk people 
into doing what you wanted, so when interviewed, he would give vague and 
ambiguous answers and let the interviewer find his own interpretation.  
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Saying less will keep you from saying something foolish or even dangerous. 
• 
Once the words are out you cannot take them back. 
• 
Keeping silent makes people reveal more about themselves. This is information 
you may be able to use against them later on. 
 
5. SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION – GUARD IT WITH YOUR 
LIFE. 
 
• 
Observance of the Law 
During China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D.207-265), General Liang was able to 
fool his rival Sima Yi simply by letting his track record for being an undefeated leader 
in battle do the work for him. Liang’s troops were far outnumbered by Sima Yi’s, yet 
he devised a clever last resort plan. Liang donned a Taoist robe and played the lute 
upon the wall of the city he was defending. His soldiers opened the gates and hid. 
When Sima Yi’s troops advanced upon the unguarded city, Yi recognized his 
opponent sitting alone upon the wall. Fearing a trap, Sima Yi called his soldiers to 
retreat. 
 
P.T. Barnum was an expert at destroying his competitor’s reputation. He published 
letters in newspapers, warning the public against buying his opponent’s stock. He 
was a master at poking mockery at the tactics of his rivals. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Sow doubt and spread rumors about your rival. Even if they vehemently deny it, 
people will still be wondering why they are so defensive. 
• 
Use humor or gentle mockery at your rival’s expense. 
• 
A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your strengths 
without your having to spend much energy. 
• 
Never appear desperate in your self-defense against the slander of others. 
• 
Be careful not to go too far in attacking another’s reputation, it draws more 
attention to your vengefulness than to the person you are slandering. Use subtler 
tactics like satire and ridicule. 
 
 
6. COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST.

P.T. Barnum learned about courting attention to his favor. Any form of publicity would 
benefit his entertainment business, no matter if it were bad publicity. He promoted his 
shows of curiosities to audiences with all kinds of gimmicks. He would offer Free 
Music for Millions, but hire bad musicians, so the crowd would end up buying tickets 
to the show so they could avoid the bands. He planted articles in newspapers and 
even sent anonymous letters to keep his name in the limelight. 
 
Margaretha Zelle was able to use this law to make a name for herself as the 
mysterious exotic dancer Mata Hari. It was rumored she was from India and danced 
in private parties, in an Eastern manner never before seen in Europe. She would 
slowly discard her veils and sarongs for the most prominent people in Paris who 
came to see her. Many years later it would be discovered she was just a native of 
Holland and had worked for the Germans as a spy. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Surround your name with the sensational and the scandalous. 
• 
Create an air of mystery. 
• 
It is better to be attacked and slandered than ignored. 
• 
Make yourself appear larger than life. 
• 
Any sort of notoriety will bring you power. 
 
7. GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE 
CREDIT. 
• 
Transgression and Observance of the Law 
Nicola Tesla was a Serbian scientist who never learned how this law was used 
against him time and again. His invention, the AC or alternating current system was 
associated not with his name but with that of George Westinghouse, who funded his 
research. Both Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse were ruthless 
businessmen who took credit for Tesla’s work. In the end, Tesla was living in poverty, 
while royalties for his life’s work went to Edison and Westinghouse. He accepted 
small sums as buy-outs for his work, when in reality his creations could have been 
worth millions. Even Marconi made use of a patent filed by Tesla in 1897. Tesla was 
the real “father of radio” but received no money or credit for this invention. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Save time and energy by hiring others to do the work. 
• 
Your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. 
• 
Borrow from history. Use the past and profit by others’ experience. 
• 
You can only exploit others’ talents if your position is unshakable. 
 
8. MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU – USE BAIT IF NECESSARY. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Napoleon’s former foreign minister Talleyrand was master of this law. He knew 
Napoleon loved the adoration of the masses, and this was the perfect bait to make 
the former ruler play into the hands of his opponents. In 1814 Napoleon was 
banished to a small island called Elba near Italy. Here he was given information that 
France would embrace him again if he escaped. From Elba he was able to escape 
and march back into Paris with a small army. The people bowed to him, and soldiers 
changed sides to join him. The statesmen who had taken over his empire fled. 
Talleyrand watched as his plan unfolded. Napoleon ruled France again for a hundred 
days, but the country was bankrupt and could not sustain Napoleon’s wars any 
longer. Napoleon was recaptured at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to the barren 
island St. Helena, off the west coast of Africa. This was a much further place with no 
chance of escape, and was more to Talleyrand’s liking.

Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
For negotiations and meetings, it is wise to lure others into your territory, or a 
territory of your choice. 
• 
Once someone suspects you are manipulating him, it will be harder to control 
him. Making him come to you gives the illusion he is in control. 
• 
Most often the effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be 
frustrated by the traps you set for them. 
 
9. WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Michelangelo knew how to satisfy a patron while getting his way at the same time. Piero 
Soderini, Florence’s mayor, commissioned him to transform a ruined piece of marble into 
a statue. Soderini visited the studio one day and commented that the nose of the statue 
(that of David with a sling in his hand) was too big. Michelangelo invited the mayor to 
climb up a scaffolding, allowing him to look at the nose from a different perspective, while 
the artist chiseled a bit, pretending to correct the size of the nose. The mayor was 
convinced the nose looked much better. Michelangelo succeeded in making Soderini 
think his comment had helped improve the work. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Demonstrate, do not explicate. 
• 
Arguing will only offend your superior. 
• 
Learn to demonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectly. 
• 
Choose your battles carefully. 
• 
Don’t bother demonstrating if time and experience will eventually teach the other 
person what you are trying to say. Save your energy and walk away. 
• 
No one can argue with a demonstrated proof. 
 
10. INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND THE UNLUCKY. 
• 
Transgression of the Law 
In the 1840’s Marie Gilbert, better known as Lola Montez, came to Paris to become a 
dancer and performer. She had many husbands, and caused the ruin of many a powerful 
man. Because of her ambition to be a dancer she “accidentally” ran into Alexandre 
Dujarier, then the owner of France’s most popular newspaper and a drama critic himself. 
Although still legally married to an Englishman with whom she eloped at 19, Lola kept her 
status secret from all her husbands. Dujarier was shot dead defending her honor at a 
duel against another drama critic. Lola went on to have several husbands, even causing 
King Ludwig of Bavaria to abdicate. She left another man who later fell into a deep 
depression, became a drunkard, and eventually died at a relatively young age. The man 
who published her autobiography went bankrupt. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
In the game of power, the people you associate with are critical. 
• 
An infector can be recognized by the misfortune they draw on themselves, their 
turbulent past, a long line of broken relationships, unstable careers, the very 
intensity of their emotions, and the force of their character. 
• 
Gravitate towards prosperous, cheerful, and gregarious people.  
• 
Never associate with those who share your defects. 
 
 
11. LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
The 48 Laws Of Power

Michelangelo was able to keep his patron Pope Julius II dependent on him. When he and 
the pope quarreled over the building of the pope’s marble tomb, Michelangelo left Rome 
in disgust. The pope sought him out and begged the artist to stay. Michelangelo knew he 
could always find another patron, but the pope knew he could not find another 
Michelangelo. 
 
Michelangelo’s power was intensive, depending on one skill. Henry Kissinger’s power 
was extensive. He was so involved in so many areas of the political structure that to 
remove him would lead to chaos. The intensive form of power provides more freedom 
than the extensive. 
 
Machiavelli said it is better to be feared than loved. Fear can be controlled; love, never. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Be the only one who can do what you do. Make the fate of those who hire you so 
entwined with yours they cannot possibly get rid of you. 
• 
If you are ambitious, it is wiser to seek out weak masters with whom you can 
create a relationship of dependency. 
• 
Possess a talent or creative skill that sets you apart from the crowd. 
• 
By knowing other people’s secrets and holding information they wouldn’t want 
made public, you seal your fate with theirs. 
 
12. USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR 
VICTIM. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Count Victor Lustig promised Al Capone into giving him $50,000 on the terms that he 
would double this investment in sixty days. Lustig kept the money untouched in a safety 
deposit box. After the sixty days were up, he apologized to Capone saying he had failed 
to double the money. Capone expected either $100,000, or nothing, what he did not 
expect was an honest gesture of Lustig actually returning the $50,000. Al Capone was a 
man who lived in constant mistrust of people around him, and was so touched by the 
honest gesture he gave Lustig an extra $5,000. 
 
The classic tale of the Fall of Troy is one example of hiding your ulterior motives within a 
gift. The Trojan Horse was designed to hold soldiers that would attack the city of Troy 
and recapture Helen who had been taken away from the Greeks by Paris. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
The essence of deception is distraction. An act of kindness, generosity, or 
honesty will distract and disarm people and turn them into gullible children. 
• 
Give before you take. 
• 
Nothing in the realm of power is set in stone. Overt deceptiveness may 
sometimes cover your tracks. If you have a history of deceit behind you, then 
play the rogue, be consistent and this will be interpreted as you simply being 
yourself. Your dishonesty becomes an act of honesty. 
 
13. WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELF-INTEREST, 
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Genghis Khan was known for his greed and self-interest. When he conquered China, 
instead of slaughtering all the citizens, his adviser Yelu Ch’u-Ts’ai persuaded him to reap 
the benefits of their new territory by taxing its people. It was Ts’ai who also convinced 
Khan to spare the inhabitants of Kaifeng, where China’s finest craftsmen and engineers 
had fled. Ts’ai’s reasoning was Khan could use these people for his own benefit.

Most people are very pragmatic, and when negotiating, do not bring up the need for 
gratitude for what you have done for others in the past. These appeals will be ignored. 
Pragmatic people look towards the future, so it is best to emphasize how they will benefit 
from an alliance with you.  
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Understand the other person’s motivation. 
• 
See things their way and offer suggestions that will advance their cause. 
• 
For others who want to feel superior and do not want to appear selfish, appeal to 
their need to display their charity in the public eye.  
 
14. POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Joseph Duveen was the greatest art dealer of his time; from 1904-1940 he single-
handedly monopolized the art-collecting market through his ingenious spying tactics. He 
would place the household employees of his potential clients on his own payroll. These 
spies would provide him valuable information as the tastes of his mark. He would arrange 
“accidental” meetings in elevators, leading his prey of wealthy patrons right into his trap. 
When clients came to visit his galleries, they found themselves surrounded by works they 
would most likely buy. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Gather information at social events when people’s guards are down. 
• 
Use other people to give you the information you need. 
• 
Mislead others by giving out false information. Watch them react and base your 
next action on what you discover. 
 
15. CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
The great Empress Wu of China was ruthless in her rise to power. She started out as a 
concubine of an emperor, but did not want to follow the traditional path: that of living the 
rest of her life in a convent after the emperor’s death. She had seduced the emperor’s 
son in the royal urinal and befriended his wife. Because of this Wu was able to get a royal 
edict out of the convent. She returned to the harem, became pregnant, and murdered her 
own baby, knowing the prime suspect would be the jealous wife of the new emperor. The 
wife was charged with murder and executed. Wu took her place and her new husband 
handed over the reins of government to her, opting for a life of pleasure. Empress Wu 
ruled until the age of eighty when she was forced to abdicate. Throughout her rule she 
eliminated son after son, anyone who would challenge her throne. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Show no mercy. Crush your rivals or else you will give them time to regroup and 
plot their revenge. 
• 
Banish enemies or plot for the best time to render them harmless. 
• 
Leave your enemies no options. 
• 
Sometimes enemies will destroy themselves.  
• 
Thoughts of reconciliation will open you up to attack. 
 
 
 
16. USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR. 
•

This law is most appreciated in matters of seduction and love. Make yourself too 
available and your presence will be taken for granted. In the Middle Ages, ladies played 
the game of presence and absence by sending their knights off on long arduous quests. 
Sir Guillaume de Balaun wanted to taste the joy of love after reconciliation, and twice he 
intentionally made himself scarce, withdrawing his affections from Madame Guillelma de 
Javiac. The first time he drove his lover wild with grief, the second time she became 
angry and cut him off. When he wrote her begging to be let back into her favor, she 
allowed him back only on the condition he do penance for his cruelty. 
 
With business, an early retirement at the height of your career will keep people holding 
you in high regard, and waiting to see you make a comeback. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Create value through scarcity. Make yourself less accessible; otherwise the aura 
you have created around yourself will wear away. 
 
17. KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF 
UNPREDICTABILITY. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Bobby Fischer beat chess champion Boris Spassky using this law of unpredictability. 
Spassky’s method of playing chess was to base his strategy on the patterns he read in 
his opponent’s moves. Fischer unnerved him by arriving late for the first two tournaments, 
even letting a match get forfeited. On the third game he made moves that were so 
uncharacteristic and bold Spassky was thrown off balance. Fourteen games later 
Spassky claimed Fischer was probably putting drugs in the orange juice they drank while 
playing. Spassky resigned a few months later and never recovered from his defeat. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
A person of power instills fear by deliberately unsettling those around him to keep 
the initiative on his side. 
• 
Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner. 
 
18. DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF – 
ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
King Louis XIV recognized the importance of always keeping his eyes and ears on 
everyone and everything around him. He built a palace in Versailles where all the nobility 
could keep apartments near to his. He knew that if he were to isolate himself for one 
moment, conspiracies would rise behind his back. The daily activities all revolved around 
the king, leaving no one unnoticed, hundreds of visitors and attendants were always 
present. There was not very much privacy for the king and he preferred this life to one of 
isolation. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
A fortress may be impregnable, but everyone knows you are there and it may easily 
turn into a prison. 
• 
Power depends on social interaction and circulation. 
• 
Isolation is deadly for the creative arts. Shakespeare was always producing plays for 
the masses. He was in constant touch with reality and what people wanted. 
• 
Mobility and social contact protects you from plotters. 
 
19. KNOW WHO YOU’RE DEALING WITH – DO NOT OFFEND THE 
WRONG PERSON. 
•

In the early thirteenth century, Muhammad the Shah of Khwarezm made the grave 
mistake in offending a new tribal leader who was emerging in the east. His name was 
Genghis Khan. Khan offered to share the Silk Route with Muhammad, sending 
ambassadors to forge a deal. After his ambassadors were beheaded, Genghis Khan 
declared war. Eventually his forces seized the capital of the Shah’s empire, Samarkand. 
Muhammad fled, and the Silk Route fell into the hands of Genghis Khan. 
 
Learn to distinguish from opponent, sucker, and victim. The five difficult and sometimes 
dangerous marks are: the arrogant and proud, the hopelessly insecure, the suspicious, 
the serpent with a long memory, and the plain, unassuming, unintelligent man. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Measure up your opponent, but never rely on instinct. Do some research on concrete 
facts about that person’s character and history. 
• 
Never trust appearances. 
 
20. DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
Queen Elizabeth I managed to avoid the trap of marriage and war, by dangling the 
possibility of marriage to all who courted her. She forged alliances with the countries 
these suitors came from, all for the benefit of England. By keeping her independence 
above all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
By refusing to commit, but allowing yourself to be courted, you become powerful 
because you are ungraspable. 
• 
As your reputation for independence grows, more people will desire you and want to 
conquer you. 
• 
Politely decline. You cannot allow yourself to feel obligated to anyone. 
• 
Seek promises from both sides, so no matter what the outcome of an election or 
battle, your position is secure. 
• 
Observe quarreling parties and stay neutral but supportive to both sides. Gain power 
as a mediator. 
• 
You may commit to one to prove you are capable of attachment, but be emotionally 
uninvolved. Preserve the unspoken option of being able to leave anytime and reclaim 
your freedom. The friends you made while being courted will help you jump ship. 
 
21. PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER – SEEM DUMBER THAN 
YOUR MARK. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
In what was the biggest diamond scam of the century, prospectors Philip Arnold and 
John Slack fooled the biggest financiers of the time, Asbury Harpending, Baron 
Rothschild, and William Ralston into investing their millions in a fake mine site. The two 
men played up their small town, scruffy image; convincing the sophisticated tycoons that 
they would easily be bought out for their discovery of the mines. In the end, after the legal 
pay-off was made to the two men, the investors realized the mine had been salted with 
uncut gems by Arnold and Slack. Since all the business had been legal, and experts had 
inspected the mines, there was no way to go after the two men. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Intelligence is an important part of people’s vanity. Subliminally reassure your 
opponent of his superiority. 
• 
Playing naïve lets you see opportunities to deceive others.

22. USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO 
POWER. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
German writer Bertolt Brecht was called to appear before the US Congress’s House of 
Un-American Activities Committee during the heyday of the Communist investigations. 
Unlike his companions in the Hollywood 19, (other producers, directors and writers who 
espoused communism in their scripts) he chose to be respectful to the committee. Subtly 
he mocked them by offering vague but polite answers, used an interpreter to run circles 
around them when asked about the lines from his poems, and was summarily dismissed. 
He was free to leave America and continue writing as he pleased, while his friends in 
Hollywood lost valuable working years as a result of being blacklisted. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Do not fight aggression with aggression. Put your opponent off-guard by yielding, and 
in effect have more control over the situation. 
• 
Surrender is a way of mocking your enemies. 
• 
Surrender disguises your real motives and allows time to plan your next move. 
 
23. CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES. 
• 
Observance of the Law 
The Rothschild banking family concentrated its wealth within a very tight-knit structure. 
Five brothers each controlled a part of the empire from Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, Naples, 
to London. They established themselves as a powerful force in business and politics, 
keeping the secrets of the family business by exchanging internal communications only in 
code or Frankfurt Yiddish. Family policy ruled and their children intermarried, all of them 
first cousins. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Single-mindedness of purpose and total concentration on one goal will overwhelm 
the enemy every time. 
• 
A single patron appreciates your loyalty and becomes dependent on your services. 
• 
In the arts, being too single-minded can make you an intolerable bore. 
 
24. PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER.

Julius Caesar always incorporated drama and theatrics in his speeches and daily 
appearances. He was a great public showman, timing his entrances and exits, 
sponsoring extravagant spectacles, gladiator shows and theatrical events. The masses 
loved him, but his rivals feared him. 
 
Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her husband and family in the provinces to become a writer in 
Paris, something unheard of and almost impossible for a woman to do in 1831. For the 
publication of her novel Indiana, she assumed the pseudonym George Sand. She 
dressed in men’s breeches, smoked cigars, and expressed herself in conversation like a 
man. She even carried on affairs with the most famous artists of Europe - Musset, Liszt, 
and Chopin - living with freedom and independence unlike any other female writer before 
her. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Control your appearances and emotions. Play sincere, but not necessarily be 
sincere. 
• 
Create a memorable character. Do not limit yourself to the role society assigns to 
you. 
 
26. KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN. 
Observance of the Law: 
Cleopatra was always able to get people to do her bidding without them realizing she was 
manipulating them.  She was able to charm Julius Caesar into restoring her to the throne 
of Egypt, and playing her siblings against each other. Marc Antony was seduced by her, 
and had her younger sister Arsinoe executed, ridding Cleopatra of any threats to her 
place as Queen. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Conceal your mistakes. Your good name and reputation depends more on what you 
conceal than on what you reveal. 
• 
Always have a convenient scapegoat. 
• 
Never do the dirty work yourself. 
 
27. PLAY ON PEOPLE’S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULT-LIKE 
FOLLOWING. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Keep it simple; keep it vague. Create new words for vague concepts. 
• 
Emphasize the visual and sensual over the intellectual. 
• 
Borrow the forms of organized religion to structure the group. Create rituals. Use 
names and ranks and titles. Ask them to make sacrifices and give alms. Act like a 
guru or a prophet. 
• 
Disguise your source of income. 
• 
Set up an us-versus-them dynamic. Keep followers united by identifying outsiders as 
a devious enemy. 
• 
The tendency to doubt and reason is broken down when we join a group. 
 
28. ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS. 
Ivan the Terrible waited five years before executing his first major bold move. After years 
of persecution by the Shuisky family, the poisoning of his mother Helena, and the 
banishment of his only friend Vorontsov, the thirteen year-old Ivan invited his rival Prince 
Andrei Shuisky into his room. No one feared the young boy and the boyars often ridiculed 
him. When the guards were suddenly ordered to seize Prince Andrei and execute him, no 
one saw it coming. This one swift and bold act secured Ivan’s power for decades to 
come.

Ivan initially lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited until he had won 
over the palace guards to his side. They had come to hate the cruelty of the Shuiskys 
over the years, and the time was at hand to strike boldly and swiftly. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
The bolder the lie, the better. 
• 
Lions circle the hesitant prey. 
• 
Boldness strikes fear; Fear creates authority. 
• 
Going halfway digs the deeper grave. Do not negotiate if you opponent will more 
likely take the opportunity to destroy you. 
• 
Hesitation creates gaps. Boldness obliterates them. Move swiftly and surely. 
• 
Audacity separates you from the herd. 
 
29. PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Take into account all possible obstacles and circumstances that may prevent you 
from achieving your goal, and plan how you will overcome them. 
• 
When you see several steps ahead, you will no longer need to improvise along the 
way, and risk deviating from your plan. 
• 
Prepare alternatives and be open to adapt new routes to your goal. 
 
 
30. MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS. 
Observance of the Law: 
Sen no Rikyu was an important tea master and adviser on aesthetic and political matters 
to the Emperor Hideyoshi. He despised hosts who looked like they were trying to hard.  
Cha-no-yu, or the Japanese tea ceremony, is an art form, from the preparation to the 
serving; the whole process must look natural and easy. Accidental grace and beauty 
were Rikyu’s specialty. On the night before the Emperor was to visit him for a tea 
ceremony, he artfully laid cushions in the snow on each stepping-stone to his house. In 
the morning, he removed the cushions revealing the pattern of the stepping-stones like a 
perfect mold within the snow. This was just one of Rikyu’s clever aesthetic tricks which 
impressed the Emperor, never calling attention to the work gone into it, but implying a 
polite gesture in itself. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
What imitates nature by appearing effortless and natural approximates nature’s 
power. 
• 
Never show your work until it is finished. When people see the effort and time it takes 
to make it, and if they witness a work-in-progress, the magic of the finished piece is 
spoiled. 
 
31. CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS 
YOU DEAL. 
Observance of the Law: 
Seventeenth-century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos needed to devise a way of 
maintaining her lifestyle while having the freedom no woman could achieve in her day. 
She gave her lovers and suitors three choices, a payeur would pay for her services, but 
she would only sleep with him when she liked, a martyr would not have to pay, and be 
part of her harem of men, and from the martyrs she would choose a favori, or one man to 
whom she would abandon herself to totally until she was tired of him. The payeurs were 
able to finance her needs while she enjoyed complete freedom, independence, and 
variety from her lovers. She had the equality to men no married woman of the time could 
possess.

Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Make people your puppets and give them options to let them feel they have control. 
Force them to choose between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your 
purpose. 
• 
Present options but color the one you prefer as the best solution. 
• 
Force the resister into “choosing” to do what you want by appearing to advocate the 
opposite. 
• 
Alter the playing field so the only options available are the ones you offer. 
• 
Shrinking options force people to buy in now or else the goods won’t be available 
tomorrow. 
• 
The weak man must be propelled into action through fear and terror. 
• 
Involving your victim in your scheme with the threat of their exposure later will keep 
them tied to you. They cannot expose you because they will be found out as well. 
• 
Use the horns of a dilemma: whichever way they choose, there is no escape. 
 
32. PLAY TO PEOPLE’S FANTASIES. 
Observance of the Law: 
In the 1700s, a mysterious stranger named George Psalmanazar came to fame with his 
books and lectures on the language, culture and history of the island of Formosa (now 
Taiwan).  After his death, it was revealed that he was in fact a Frenchman with a rich 
imagination who played on the British need for the exotic and strange. He had invented 
everything he had professed to be an expert on, having capitalized on it with best-selling 
books and having been a favorite guest at many royal dinners. 
 
Abraham Lincoln created an image of himself as the homespun country lawyer with a 
beard. He played to the fantasy of the common man’s president. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
People need a fantasy to escape from the humdrum of everyday life. The more 
vague and exotic, the more captivating. 
• 
Promise a pot of gold and instant gratification, rather than a gradual improvement 
through hard work. 
• 
Keep your distance so the fantasy remains intact. 
 
33. DISCOVER EACH MAN’S THUMBSCREW. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Every person has a weakness or insecurity you can use to your advantage. 
• 
Train yourself to probe for weaknesses in everyday conversation. 
• 
Find the childhood need that went unfulfilled, supply it, and your victim will be unable 
to resist you. 
• 
People’s weaknesses are the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you. The shy 
person is actually dying for attention; a prude may be hiding a lascivious soul, etc. 
• 
Find the weak link or the one person in a group who will bend under pressure. 
• 
Feed on uncontrollable emotions or motive – paranoia, lust, greed, vanity, or hatred.  
• 
When searching for suckers, always look for the unhappy, insecure and dissatisfied. 
 
34. BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE 
TREATED LIKE ONE. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
How you carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. Exude confidence and the 
feeling you were destined for greatness. 
The 48 Laws Of Power 
 
Page 15 
www.bizsum.com 
© 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com 
• 
Do not confuse regal bearing with arrogance. 
• 
Dignity is the mask you assume under difficult circumstances. Act like nothing can 
affect you and you have all the time in the world to respond. 
• 
Set your price high and do not waver. 
• 
Deal with the highest person in the building. 
• 
A gift is an equalizer. You do not beg but ask for help in a dignified way. 
 
35. MASTER THE ART OF TIMING. 
Time as a human-made concept 
There are three kinds of time we deal with when building power: the Long Time is the 
years-long period of waiting for the right opportunity while creating a strong foundation or 
base to work from. Forced Time is upsetting the timing of others and setting their 
deadlines for them. The opponent will be more likely to make mistakes because of the 
need to hurry, or in the case of business, will be forced to buy whatever you offer 
because the time to make a decision is limited. End Time is when we execute a plan with 
speed and absolutely no hesitation. 
 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Never look as though you are in a hurry. It betrays a lack of control. 
• 
Learn to stand back and be patient. Strike only when the time is right. 
• 
Anticipate events and work with the spirit of the times. 
• 
Recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean running with them. 
 
36. DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE 
BEST REVENGE. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him. The less interest you 
show, the more superior you seem. 
• 
Remember: You choose to let things bother you. You can just as easily choose to 
consider the matter trivial and unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful move. 
• 
If it is impossible to ignore, then secretly get rid of it. Sometimes threats just go away by 
themselves. 
 
37. CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. 
• 
Associate yourself with colors, images and symbols that communicate strong 
messages. 
• 
People are always impressed by the superficial appearance of things, the grand, and 
the spectacular, what is larger than life. 
 
38. THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display conventional behavior 
and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in them. 
• 
Put on the mask appropriate to the group you are joining. 
 
39. STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Anger and emotion are strategically unproductive. Make your enemies angry but stay 
calm yourself. 
The 48 Laws Of Power 
 
Page 16 
www.bizsum.com 
© 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com 
• 
Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous. 
• 
Nothing in the game of power is personal. 
• 
An occasional outburst may be powerful, but use anger too often and it loses its 
power. 
40. DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
By paying your own way you stay free of gratitude. What is offered for free normally 
has a hidden obligation. 
• 
Generosity is a sign of power. Most powerful people spend freely and are not misers. 
• 
Use money as a way to give pleasure to others and win them over. 
 
41. AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN’S SHOES. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Choose a different path and personal style if you are the daughter or son of a great 
person. You will forever be in your predecessor’s shadow unless you find a way to 
shine on your own. 
• 
Only after the father figure has been done away with will there be space to establish 
a new order. 
• 
Do not become complacent once you reach success and security. Prosperity makes 
us lazy. Writers like Tennessee Williams and Fyodor Dostoyevsky preferred the 
struggle to security; the way poverty or emotional difficulties pushed them to create 
good work. 
 
42. STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Within any group, trouble can be traced to a single source, the unhappy, 
chronically unsatisfied one who stirs up dissension and infects the group. 
Recognize troublemakers by their complaining nature. Separate him from the 
group. 
• 
In every group power is concentrated in the hands of one or two people. Human 
nature shows people will orbit around a single strong personality. 
 
43. WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS. 
Transgression of the Law 
Marie-Antoinette was put to death by guillotine in 1793, after the French monarchy was 
ended by the revolution. Not a single soul came to her defense. Marie-Antoinette brought 
upon herself the hatred of all. Her jewelry, wardrobe, hair, and masked balls, her lavish 
lifestyle had been more important to her than the needs of her people. 
  
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Aim at the primary emotions: love, hate, and jealousy. Be alert to people’s 
individual psychologies and their basic emotional responses. 
• 
Maintain a stable of writers, artists, or intellectuals who are very good at 
appealing to people’s hearts and minds. 
 
44. DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
The neutralizing effect: Do what your enemies do, follow their actions and they 
will not see what you are up to. When you mirror them, if mocks and humiliates 
them. Mimicry infuriates. 
• 
The Shadow effect: Shadow your opponents’ every move, gather information, 
and gain insight to their routines and habits without them seeing you. 
The 48 Laws Of Power

• 
The Mirror effect: Show you understand by reflecting their innermost feelings. 
• 
The Moral effect: Teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own 
medicine. 
• 
The Hallucinatory effect: offer a perfect copy of an object, place or person and 
see how people take the bait. 
 
45. PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO 
MUCH AT ONCE. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Make change and reform seem like a gentle improvement on the past. People 
are creatures of habit and the sudden change will cause some to rebel. 
• 
Disguise change by dressing it in tradition. 
 
46. NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
Never underestimate the power of envy. Occasionally reveal a weakness, defect, 
or anxiety, or find new friends. It is the people in your own circle of peers who will 
be the first to envy your success. 
• 
Envy is often a problem for people who have great natural talent. You may think 
you are charming people with your natural talent when in fact they are coming to 
hate you for it. 
• 
To deflect envy, employ a display of weakness, or a harmless vice. 
• 
Envy is disguised sometimes as excessive praise, or slander and criticism. Win 
your revenge by ignoring the envious. 
• 
Reversal: Display the utmost disdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding 
your perfection, make it obvious. Make every triumph an opportunity to make the 
envious squirm. 
 
47. DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; IN VICTORY, LEARN 
WHEN TO STOP. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
• 
The powerful know that the essence of strategy is controlling what comes next. 
• 
There is no better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. 
 
48. ASSUME FORMLESSNESS. 
Wisdom in a nutshell: 
Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. Be as fluid and formless as 
water, adapting and moving with change naturally. The powerful are creative in 
expressing something new. This feminine, formless style of ruling as practiced by 
Elizabeth of England and Catherine of Russia, allows flexibility and makes subjects feel 
less coerced. Play the chameleon but break your enemy from the inside. Morph and 
adapt but keep your long-term strategy in mind at all times.
